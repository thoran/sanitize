<p>Sanitize is a whitelist-based HTML sanitizer. Given a list of acceptable
elements and attributes, Sanitize will remove all unacceptable HTML from a
string.</p>

<p>Using a simple configuration syntax, you can tell Sanitize to allow certain
elements, certain attributes within those elements, and even certain URL
protocols within attributes that contain URLs. Any HTML elements or attributes
that you don't explicitly allow will be removed.</p>

<p>Sanitize is based on <a href="https://github.com/google/gumbo-parser">Google's Gumbo HTML5 parser</a>, which parses HTML
exactly the same way modern browsers do. As long as your whitelist config only
allows safe markup, even the most malformed or malicious input will be
transformed into safe output.</p>
